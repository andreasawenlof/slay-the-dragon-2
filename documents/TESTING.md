## Additional Notes

-   If a test fails, document the **bug or unexpected behavior** under **Issues Found** below.
-   Any additional edge cases should be noted and tested separately.

## Issues Found

-   When using an item and it asks you what you want to use it on, if you write "inv" etc you crash
-   Obviously, not using the exact correct names crashes
-   Attack doesn't work on dragon and maybe it should be an "what do you want to attack the dragon with?"
-   open only works on the chest nothing else could work on exists but not sure, it might become a future feature.
-   Winning the game does not quit the game or take you to a menu also needed to be implemented.
-   Prob should be able to just write, walk, open, take etc and ask "command what?"

# Additional Testing - Error Handling & Edge Cases

## Overview

This document outlines additional test cases focusing on **error handling, invalid inputs, and edge cases** for the **Slay the Dragon** text-based adventure.

## Test Cases

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1a. Input action and item with mixed casing (`TAKE sword`, `wAlK door`)**              | Commands should be case-insensitive (converted to lowercase)                   | Tells me that it doesn't understand the command. | ✅ (fixed)    | Added `.lower()` to `action[0]` before processing the command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **1b. Input only item with mixed casing (`take sWoRd`, `walk DoOr`)**                    | Commands should be case-insensitive (converted to lowercase)                   | Game Crashes                                     | ✅ (fixed)    | Fixed by converting `action[1]` (the item/exit name) to lowercase before passing it into functions. This ensures case-insensitive input handling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **2a. Entering a command without arguments (`walk`, `use` etc)**                         | Should ask the player **"Walk where?"** or **"Use what?"** instead of crashing | Game Crashes                                     | ✅ (Fixed)    | Fixed by checking if the player enters `walk`, `use` and other commands without a second argument. Instead of crashing, the game now prints an appropriate message guiding the player.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **2b. Entering a command without arguments with mixed casing (`wAlK`, `uSe`)**           | Should give the same outcome as above **"Walk where?"** or **"Use what?"**     | Tells me that it doesn't understand the command. | ✅ (Fixed)    | Same as above mention and because of fix from issue: 1. Where we fixed so actions are always converted to lowercase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **3a. Entering completely invalid command (`fly dragon`, `eat sword`)**                  | Should print **"I don't know how to [command]"**                               | Tells me that it doesn't understand the command. | ✅            | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **3b. Entering correct command but invalid item/exit (`take dragon`, `walk pony`)**      | Should print **"I don't know how to [command]"** instead of crashing           | ✅ Game Crashes                                  | ✅ (Fixed)    | Checked if the exit/item exists in the current room. If not, prints a message telling the player it doesn't exist instead of causing a crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **4. Trying to use an item that is NOT in inventory (`use sword` before picking it up)** | Should print **"You don’t have that item!"** instead of crashing               | Game Crashes                                     | ✅ (fixed)    | Fixed by checking if the item exists in the player's inventory before proceeding. If the item is not found, the game now prints `"You don’t have '[item]' in your inventory!"` instead of crashing.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **5. Trying to take an item that doesn’t exist (`take banana`)**                         | Should print **"There is no banana here."** instead of crashing                | Game Crashes                                     | ✅ (fixed)    | Fixed by checking if the item exists before calling `take_item()`. If it doesn’t exist, the game now prints `"There is no '[item]' here."` instead of crashing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **6. Using `use` but entering an invalid target (`use key on chair`)**                   | Should print **"You can’t use that here."**                                    | Game Crashes                                     | ✅ (fixed)    | Fixed by checking if the exit exists in the current room before proceeding. If the exit does not exist, the game now prints `"There is no exit called '[use_on]'."` instead of crashing. Fixed by checking if the static item exists before applying effects. If the item is not found, the game now prints `"You can't use '[action[1]]' on '[use_on]'."` instead of crashing. |
