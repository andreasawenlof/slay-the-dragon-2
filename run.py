Static Items:
    Stationary in the room (cannot be moved) CHECK
        - print static items
    
    Interaction with static items
        Define what actions are allowed with respective static items
            - if action is allowed do action
                - call the appropriate action function (we start with open)

            - if action not allowed shame user
                - get static item key from static item name
                - get static item object from static item key
                - get message from not allowed in static item object
                - print message


        User write to open openable static items (COMPLETE LATER just add an empty function)
            - get item key from item name
            - action with item key
    
    
    State of item to change when interaction has been done
    
    
    static item kunna ha items i sig: CHECKED
        - ändra i json så att items kan vara i static items 
    
    
    vid interaction ska items flyttas till spelaren
